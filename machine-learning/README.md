# Deep Learning Mini Projects

# Overview
This repository contains a collection of small Deep learning projects implemented to understand core concepts of neural networks, supervised learning, and sequence modeling. These projects are focused on learning-by-building rather than production deployment.

The notebooks and scripts emphasize data preprocessing, model design, training workflows, and result interpretation.
