# Data Analysis & Machine Learning Mini Projects

# Overview
This repository contains a collection of small, focused data analysis and machine learning projects implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each notebook explores a different dataset with the goal of understanding data patterns, applying basic machine learning techniques, and strengthening core data science fundamentals.

These projects are intentionally kept lightweight and exploratory, emphasizing clarity of thought, data preprocessing, and interpretation of results.

# Approach
Across all notebooks, the general workflow includes:
- Loading and inspecting datasets
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature understanding through visualization
- Applying basic machine learning concepts where relevant
- Interpreting results rather than optimizing for scores

---

# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Datasets
Datasets are not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints.

Common sources include:
- Kaggle
- Public open datasets
- Standard ML datasets (e.g., Iris)

Instructions to run:
1. Download the dataset from the respective source
2. Place it in the same directory as the notebook
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially
