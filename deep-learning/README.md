# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

# Overview
This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning projects built to strengthen core concepts across supervised learning, neural networks, time-series analysis, recommender systems, and security-focused applications.

These projects are learning-oriented and emphasize understanding data, choosing appropriate models, and interpreting results rather than production deployment.
