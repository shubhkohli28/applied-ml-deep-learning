# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Portfolio

## Overview
This repository is a curated collection of data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning projects built to strengthen core concepts through hands-on implementation. The focus of this work is practical learning—understanding data, models, and workflows—rather than production deployment.

The projects are organized to reflect a progression from exploratory data analysis to classical machine learning and applied deep learning.

## Repository Structure

### 📊 Data Analysis
The `data-analysis` folder contains exploratory data analysis projects focused on understanding datasets, cleaning data, visualizing patterns, and extracting insights.

Typical work includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization and interpretation

---

### 🤖 Machine Learning
The `machine-learning` folder includes supervised learning projects such as classification and regression. These projects focus on applying classical machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets.

Typical work includes:
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Interpreting model performance

---

### 🧠 Deep Learning
The `deep-learning` folder contains projects that explore neural networks and deep learning techniques, including applications in NLP, image recognition, recommendation systems, and security-focused problems.

Typical work includes:
- Neural network design
- Training and validation workflows
- Comparing model architectures
- Analyzing results and limitations

## Flagship Projects
If you are reviewing this repository, the following projects best represent my applied learning and problem-solving approach:

- **IMDB Sentiment Analysis** — Deep learning–based text classification using RNN, LSTM, and GRU models  
- **Intrusion Detection System** — Machine learning applied to cybersecurity and anomaly detection  
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection** — Classification on highly imbalanced financial data  

These projects demonstrate stronger end-to-end thinking compared to the exploratory notebooks.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Datasets
Datasets are not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints.

Common sources include:
- Kaggle
- Public open datasets
- Standard machine learning datasets

To run a project:
1. Download the dataset from the referenced source
2. Place it in the project directory
3. Run the notebook or script sequentially
